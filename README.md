# Log_in_Register_And_DataBase_Using_Firebase
Using the google tool Firebase, I create a Log in/Register and a Database Users. If you start the project clicking on the .xcworkspace, it sould be work. Any question please ask ;)


Log in and Register App where you can also insert the users UID, nickname, name, etc using Firebase.

You have 3 Views:

  StartView with ViewController -> Shows Log in & Register 
  HomeView with HomeViewController -> Shows a hello
  RegisterView with RegisterUserViewController -> Shows Nickname, name, surname and image to save is on the usersDatabase (Google Firebase)
  UpdateProfileView -> Update the image & data user and shows you the old information


In the future I will put a user settings to change the user information. ;)
